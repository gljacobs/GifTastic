# GifTastic

* This app is GifTastic. A user can use the input field/submit button to add a button with the value of their text input. When the newly created button is clicked, the app calls upon the GIPHY API and searches for gifs relevant to the buttons value. For example, if in the input field you submit "dog", a new button of value "dog" is appended to the appropriate button area and when clicked it will render gifs of dogs. The user is able to play and pause gifs when clicked.
